        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            I am a student graduating this year. I really like JavaScript
            since I got familiar with it during my course project (you can
            look at it <a href="https://github.com/BlackCat1397/Greenhouse">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the begining of 2018 I am intern in one cool startup. Here I work
            with React-native, Metheor.js and sometimes with Swift code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to try Rolling Scopes School because I want to improve my skills and 
            because I've heard tons of good reviews about this courses.
        </p>
