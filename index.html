          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>
              I am a student graduating this year. I really like JavaScript
              since I got familiar with it during my course project (you can
              look at it <a href="https://github.com/BlackCat1397/Greenhouse">here</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
              Since the begining of 2018 I am intern in one cool startup. Here I work
              with React-native, Metheor.js and sometimes with Swift code.
          </p>
          <p>
              I decided to try Rolling Scopes School because I want to improve my skills and 
              because I've heard tons of good reviews about this courses.
